# Movie Recommendation System

A Python-based movie recommendation system that leverages machine learning algorithms to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences and viewing history.

## 📋 Overview

This project implements a comprehensive movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. The system analyzes user behavior patterns and movie features to generate accurate and personalized recommendations.

## 🚀 Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on similar users' preferences
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests movies based on movie features and genres
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines multiple recommendation techniques for better accuracy
- **User Profile Analysis**: Builds comprehensive user preference profiles
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates recommendation quality using various metrics

## 🔬 Research Foundation

This implementation is based on extensive research in recommendation systems. The following research papers were referenced during development:

- See `research_papers/` directory for detailed academic references
- Implementation follows state-of-the-art techniques in collaborative filtering
- Incorporates latest advances in matrix factorization and deep learning approaches

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Surprise** - Recommendation system library
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Development and analysis

## 📊 Dataset

The movie recommendation system uses a comprehensive dataset containing:

- User ratings and preferences
- Movie metadata (genres, cast, directors, release dates)
- User demographic information
- Viewing history and timestamps

**Note**: Due to the large size of the dataset (exceeding GitHub's file size limits), it is not included in this repository. If you need access to the dataset for research or implementation purposes, please contact me at **mehern23@iitk.ac.in**.

🎯 Usage
Basic Usage
pythonfrom src.hybrid_recommender import HybridRecommender

# Initialize the recommender
recommender = HybridRecommender()

# Load and preprocess data
recommender.load_data('data/movies.csv', 'data/ratings.csv')

# Train the model
recommender.train()

# Get recommendations for a user
user_id = 123
recommendations = recommender.get_recommendations(user_id, n_recommendations=10)

print(f"Top 10 movie recommendations for user {user_id}:")
for movie, score in recommendations:
    print(f"{movie}: {score:.2f}")
Advanced Usage
python# Custom parameter tuning
recommender = HybridRecommender(
    collaborative_weight=0.7,
    content_weight=0.3,
    n_factors=100,
    learning_rate=0.01
)

# Evaluate model performance
from src.evaluation_metrics import evaluate_model

rmse, mae, precision, recall = evaluate_model(recommender, test_data)
print(f"RMSE: {rmse:.3f}, MAE: {mae:.3f}")
print(f"Precision: {precision:.3f}, Recall: {recall:.3f}")
📈 Performance Metrics
The system is evaluated using multiple metrics:

RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): Measures prediction accuracy
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Average magnitude of prediction errors
Precision@K: Relevance of top-K recommendations
Recall@K: Coverage of relevant items in top-K recommendations
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

🔧 Model Architecture

Matrix Factorization: SVD and NMF techniques
User-User Similarity: Cosine similarity and Pearson correlation
Item-Item Similarity: Content-based similarity measures

Content-Based Filtering
